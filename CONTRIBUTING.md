## Code Style and Conventions

For this project, we adhere to the `.NET coding style` guidelines. Here are some key points:

- **Naming Conventions**: Use CamelCase for method names, variable names, and properties. Use PascalCase for class names and namespaces.
- **Indentation**: Use spaces instead of tabs with a standard indent size of 4.
- **Brace Style**: Use the K&R style for braces, where the opening brace goes on the same line as the statement but the closing brace goes on its own line.

For a comprehensive guide, please refer to the [.NET coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions) provided by Microsoft.
